Omnispeak: A Commander Keen 5 Reimplementation 

Omnispeak is a re-implementation of the Keen:Galaxy engine which aims for
almost perfect, bug-for-bug compatibility with the original games. Essentially,
it is a rewrite of the keen 5 engine in modern-ish c99, based on several
disassembly/decompilation efforts.

The source is in the src/ directory. You'll want to run 'make' from within there
to get it compiling. You'll need gcc or a compatible compiler, and the Simple
Directmedia Layer (libSDL) version 1.2 or 2.0 (http://libsdl.org/). When
compiled, an 'omnispeak5e' binary will appear in 'bin/'. You'll need to copy the
game's data files, including some resources extracted from the executable.
You'll find those in the 'data/keen5' directory.

You'll also need to take the following files from Keen 5 v1.4, and place them
in the same directory as the binary:
	* GAMEMAPS.CK5
	* EGAGRAPH.CK5
	* AUDIO.CK5

To run the game, simply switch to the directory with the data files, and run:
./omnispeak5e
