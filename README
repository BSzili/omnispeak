Omnispeak: A Commander Keen 5 Reimplementation 

Omnispeak is a re-implementation of the Keen:Galaxy engine which aims for
almost perfect, bug-for-bug compatibility with the original games. Essentially,
it is a rewrite of the keen 5 engine in modern-ish c99, based on several
disassembly/decompilation efforts.

I've been working on this on-and-off for a long time, and it is nowhere near
complete. It should be pretty interesting to dig through the source code, and
most of the game physics is implemented.

The source is in the src/ directory. You'll want to run 'make' from within there
to get it compiling. You'll need gcc or a compatible compiler (set your $CC
variable if need be), and libSDL 1.2 (http://libsdl.org/). When compiled, a
'keen5e' binary will appear in 'bin/'. You'll need to run this from a directory
with all of the game's data files, including some resources extracted from the
executable.

To run, you'll need to take the following files from Keen 5 v1.4, and place them
in the data/keen5/ directory:
	* GAMEMAPS.CK5
	* EGAGRAPH.CK5

To run the game, simply switch to the directory with the data files, and run:
../../bin/keen5e

The game should then show the title screen. Press a key to start playing level
one.

Note that this is still very unfinished, and there are no enemies, keen cannot
die and there is no way to complete the level. You can try to play a different
level by modifying the source code.
