Omnispeak: A Commander Keen 5 Reimplementation
Keen Day 2014 Preview Release

Omnispeak is a re-implementation of the Keen:Galaxy engine which aims for
almost perfect, bug-for-bug compatibility with the original games. Essentially,
it is a rewrite of the keen 5 engine in modern-ish c99, based on several
disassembly/decompilation efforts.

At the moment, you can play through all of Keen 5 with Omnispeak. To get it
running you'll need to copy the AUDIO.CK5, EGAGRAPH.CK5 and GAMEMAPS.CK5 files
from Keen 5 v1.4 (this is the version you can buy on Steam) and place them into
the Omnispeak directory.

There are a few things that aren't quite finished you should know about:
- The status screen is not yet implemented.
- Nor are the "Terminator" and "Star Wars" intros.
- "High Scores" do not display.
- You can't load or save games.
- Joystick and Gamepad support is not yet implemented.
- You can't use the mouse to scroll through the menu, either.
- Not all debug cheats are implemented, and they do not need to be activated
  with A-2-Enter.
- There are some minor simulation differences which cause some custom demos to
  go out of sync.
- Some switch behaviour used in some levelpacks depends upon the exact memory
  layout of the original DOS executable, which has not yet been emulated.
- Custom levels which overlay infoplane values over animated tiles can corrupt
  memory in the original game, and may not load at this time.
- And a few other things here and there.

Note that "patches" to the original game are not (and will not) be supported.
Sprite actions, however, are read from ACTIONS.CK5, and can be modified there.
The format of this file may change, so we advise not doing anything drastic
modding-wise with Omnispeak just yet.

and the version used to build this preview is tagged "keen-day-2014".

Thanks, and Keen On!
